Moeller et al. 2014 has two fastqs: one containing gorilla and bonobo samples, the other containing all chimpanzee samples.

    "\n",
    "#### Required programs: DADA2 package\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input directory, sample names\n",
    "The input folder where we source the fastqs will vary across datasets because of variable preprocessing steps, e.g. some datasets required demultiplexing, some required primer trimming, some required both steps, others required neither and will be sourced from the data folder. Also DADA2 requires a pattern for recognizing the forward and reverse fastqs and a delimiter to use to split the sample names, these vary across datasets.\n",
    "#### Trimming lengths\n",
    "Datasets can also vary in quality across the length of a read. The truncation parameters across the datasets are mostly 145bp F, 145bp R. But Raymann et al. had bad quality reverse reads, so the truncation parameters were set to 200bp F, 100bp R. \n",
    "#### Single vs Paired reads\n",
    "Almost all of the datasets have paired end reads and were processed using the paired read DADA2 script, with the exception of those from Moeller et al. 2014 where the reads were already merged and therefore processed using the single read DADA2 script. The parameters/processing step used in single read and paired read scripts are identical. \n",
    "#### Script setup\n",
    "Required scripts, DADA2_V4, DADA2_single, DADA2_paired\n",
    "Because of these differences there are three scripts in this folder. DADA_V4 does all of the initial steps of defining indir/outdir/sample names & read truncation before funneling data into either DADA_single or DADA2_paired scripts where reads are processed uniformly."
